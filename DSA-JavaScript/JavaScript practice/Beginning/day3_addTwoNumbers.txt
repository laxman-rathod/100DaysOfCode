Add Two Numbers
---------------


Your task is very simple: given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers and output the sum.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases.
Then follow T lines, each line contains two integers, A and B.

Output Format
For each test case, add A and B and display the sum in a new line.


Sample 1:
Input   Output
3        
1  2     3
100 200  300
10 40    50

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 1+2=3. Hence the first output is 3.

Testcase 2: 100+200=300. Hence the second output is 300.
